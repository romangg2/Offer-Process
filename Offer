# FAQ: Offer process
*What happens after the “yes”* 


## Overview

**Ownership**

- Recruiter is the primary point of contact for candidate communications and for moving the conversation along in a timely manner. They should be aware of all communications (cc’d or bcc’d), and briefed after each call. Recruiter is responsible for gathering offer expectations, communicating all offer details, and assembling all formal paperwork.
- Service Owner owns decisions about compensation, bonuses, start date, and equity. They may or may not delegate this responsibility to Hiring Manager. Service Owner may step in to negotiations directly with candidate only in close coordination with Recruiter. 
- Peter and Ouliana final approval on all offers.

**Timeline**

- **Offer assembly period**
    - Recruiter gathers comp & other offer expectations from candidate prior to onsite
    - “Yes” decision made by Hiring Manager, communicated to recruiter and Service Owner
    - Recruiter (and Hiring Manager if applicable) makes recommendations on offer parameters: base comp, equity, start date
    - Service Owner signs off on parameters of preliminary (verbal) offer. May or may not involve Hiring Manager in remainder of process
    - Verbal offer made by Recruiter to candidate
- **Negotiate & sell period**
    - Negotiations with candidate and Recruiter may happen at this point, may go through multiple cycles until candidate is amenable to offer or we need to force a decision
    - Close/sell conversations arranged by Recruiter to get candidate excited (can be done at any point after we’ve indicated an offer is coming). *Note:* Offering 1 or more of these conversations with someone outside the chain of command should be considered a requirement for any L2+ or management hire
- **Formalities period**
    - Formal offer parameters go out to Service Owner, Peter, Ouliana for approval (must be approved by all 3)
    - Final offer (paperwork) assembled by Recruiter and issued to candidate, typically with 48 hours to decide
    - If offer is accepted, Recruiter hands off candidate to HR. Service Owner/Hiring Manager should notify hiring team and people involved in the process should reach out to the candidate to welcome them and share their excitement
    - If offer is declined, Recruiter follows up to understand reasoning (primary/secondary etc) and make sure we record it for later analysis
